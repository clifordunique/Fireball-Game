# Fireball-Game
A simple platformer.
To give credit where it is due, Sebastian Lague (https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan)
created the CameraFollow, Controller2D, PlatformController, Player, RaycastController, and PlayerInput classes.
The Parallaxing script is from Brackeys: https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys.
I made slight modifications to some of these files.

This is my first game so I'm keeping it small.
